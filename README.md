# Welcome to challengeMe! :white_check_mark:

Pen and paper is cool, but you just gotta code it! :desktop_computer:

## Featuring 	:pushpin:

* Diverse Data Structures and Algorithms
* Friendly comments:
  * explanations
  * time / space complexity
  * expected outputs
  * topic headings
* Oprimized algorithm progressions
## Format :bookmark_tabs:

#### Banks :classical_building:
```bash
#LISTS
# ***********************************************
# append() - Add an element to the end of the list
# extend() - Add all elements of a list to the another list
# insert() - Insert an item at the defined index
                       .
                       .
# ***********************************************

# Demonstrating insert() method
odd = [2, 7]
odd.insert(1,3)

print(odd)

odd[2:2] = [12, 13]

print(odd)

# Expect:
# [2, 3, 7]
# [2, 3, 12, 13, 7]
```
#### Problems

## Great for 	:monocle_face:

* Learning Algorithms
* Refreshing skills
* Preparing for competition/interviews
* Sharing tactics!

## Upcoming / In-development :construction_worker:
* Linear Programming:
* Spanning Trees
* Making sorting algorithms easier to understand
